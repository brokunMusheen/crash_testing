## Intro Points

## (Demo)

## Demo Recap Points

* Red-Green Testing

## (Workshop)

## Lesson Recap
* Test Driven Development (TDD) vs. Regression Tests
* Tests are:
    * Transportable
    * Reproducible
* Benefits of testing:
    * Decrease refactoring fear
    * Often leads to more comprehensible architecture, eg - tests act as a sort of 'canary'.
        * If you can't think of how to test, do you have a good specification?
        * If your test suite becomes too complex, is your code base too complex?
